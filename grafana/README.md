# Home Assistant Add-on: Grafana v7

## About

The analytics platform for all your metrics (v7).

Grafana allows you to query, visualize, alert on and understand your metrics
no matter where they are stored. Create, explore, and share dashboards. Learn
about your Home Automation system using sexy and compelling graphs, and other
data visualizations.

Combine this add-on with the InfluxDB add-on to get insanely powerful
insights to your home.

Also helps to get the TeslaMate plugin to work, which at the moment does not
fully support Grafana v8.
